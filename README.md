## About
This project was developed for a hackathon to create detailed 3D terrain maps of disaster zones using advanced photogrammetry techniques. Leveraging COLMAP, the system reconstructs high-resolution 3D models from aerial imagery captured by a coordinated drone swarm. Before processing, images are enhanced using an image denoising CNN (DnCNN) model to optimize feature extraction. The denoised images are then transmitted via the AT&T network to a server equipped with CUDA GPU acceleration, where COLMAP generates the final 3D renders.

Beyond disaster response, this technology has versatile business applications, including:

- **3D Modeling of Cell Towers and Equipment:** Enabling precise asset management and inspection.
- **Small Cell Deployment in Urban Areas:** Facilitating optimal placement and planning through detailed urban terrain mapping.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Providing first responders with rapid and accurate situational awareness to improve operational decisions.
- **Real Estate and Site Acquisition:** Offering immersive 3D visualizations for better property assessment and planning.

This integrated system combines edge computing on Raspberry Pi prototypes for initial processing with high-performance GPU servers for advanced 3D reconstruction, demonstrating a scalable pipeline from drone data capture to actionable 3D outputs.

## Image Denoising Example

To improve image quality before 3D reconstruction, noisy input images are processed through the DnCNN model. Below is a visual comparison showing the original noisy image alongside the denoised output produced by our model:
